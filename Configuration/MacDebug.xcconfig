// Annoyingly, Xcode doesn't look in the build products folder when searching for files included in xcconfig files.
// This means that we can't include things from the XCConfig framework in a totally portable way, by doing
// #include <ECConfig/ECMacDebug.xcconfig>
//
// Instead, we have to assume that the framework's source folder is actually at a known relative location.
// If this isn't the case, you'll get a build warning:
//
// ECMacDebug.xcconfig line 8: Unable to find included file...
//
// You can fix this by adding a symbolic link called ECConfig that points to the right place.

#include "../ECConfig/Configuration/ECMacDebug.xcconfig"

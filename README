Some assorted unit-testing related utilities.

Macros
------

The ECTest macros are much like the STTest ones, except that they don't take a description parameter. Instead, they generate a suitable description from the context.

In practise I find that most of the time, the description is redundant, and ends up repeating the logic of the test itself. The knowledge that an assertion has failed is usually enough, and the descriptions just add clutter to the code.


ECTestCase
----------

This class contains a few utility methods which support the macros.

ECParameterisedTestCase
-----------------------

This class allows you to define unit tests that have a series of test data items applied in turn.

See [this blog post](http://www.bornsleepy.com/bornsleepy/parameterised-unit-tests) for more details.
